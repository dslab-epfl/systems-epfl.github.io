# [](#header-1)Systems Research at EPFL

The Systems @ EPFL group of labs targets a broad spectrum of fundamental questions and emerging challenges in the scalability, dependability, efficiency, and security of computer systems. We explore new ways todesign, verify, transform, and evaluate systems of all kinds, ranging from embedded and mobile systems to data centers and geographically distributed systems. We place great emphasis on building and deploying prototypes, and we experimentally validate our research ideas.
